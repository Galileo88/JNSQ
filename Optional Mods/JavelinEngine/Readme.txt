## Javelin Engine

The T-2 Toroidal Aerospike "Javelin" Liquid Fuel Engine is designed specifically to conquer Nara. It uses a staged combustion engine cycle to produce an ultra-high combustion chamber pressure of 200 atmospheres. This allows it to produce a respectable thrust and specific impulse even at the bottom of Nara's crushing atmosphere. And its aerospike design means it provides good performance over a wide range of pressures. If you think it's cheating the solution is simple - don't use it.
