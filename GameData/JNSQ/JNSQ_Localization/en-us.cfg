		// Descriptions
		#LOC_JNSQ_Aden_desc = Aden is a small brown marble sitting in Lindor's preverbial hand. It seems like a rocky world much like the Mun or Edna but its proximity to Lindor suggests it may be very different inside. Well, that's what the old scientists with afros said to write for this.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Amos_desc = The elusive innermost moon of Nara, Amos shares in the darker tones of Nara's surface and may have a unique composition if it is correctly judged just as a book may often be judged by its cover.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Bop_desc = Bop is brown. Bop is round. Bop is the sound that was heard all around.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Celes_desc = It comes as a great coincidence that this body, prviously known as KB 4500331 was given the alias of Celes. It is often argued whether Celes could be its own dwarf planet and not a moon if Eeloo wasn't around. It is also argued to be named after a prominent, safety-minded software engineer at Probodobodyne. When Kuiper Kerman and Celes Kerman were approached by media teams they both responded 'NDA' and declined further questions.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Dak_desc = Some potatoes are small. Some potatoes are tall. Dak is a potato with a siren's call.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Dres_desc = Pale, large, and seemingly unattractive, Dres hides in plain sight. It is the largest known body in the inner asteroid belt, measured by both radius and gravioli serving size. Dres has been observed enough to be confirmed as Mun-like in size and density, and also to be the loneliest world around, second to Hamek.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Duna_desc = Duna is a curiously warm-colored planet. Its surprising lack of atmosphere clashes strongly with its ability to host what very surely are ice caps. The Kerbal Astronomical Society is confident that Duna is very approachable, in great constrast to Eve, and so is eager to launch the first several crewed expeditions in this general direction ASAP.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Edna_desc = A lonely and dark world within the local asteroid belt, most likely named after a very grumpy female scientist, Edna turned out to be harder to recognize as a planet than Dres was. Kerbal astronomers eventually realized that unlike any of the large asteroids around, Edna was particularly round, and that it would, in few but regular cases, occlude something or be occluded.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Eeloo_desc = Eeloo, the poster-child for ice worlds, is remarkably white and very difficult to look away from once clearly observed. It hosts a significant gravity well and encourages kerbal scientists to believe that a significant portion of the cosmos may consist of ice cream scoops.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Enon_desc = Little is to be expected other than flavors of ice when one ventures this far from home... But things can get interesting nonetheless, when one encounters a white moon nearly as large as Duna.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Eve_desc = Eve is an exceptionally purple planet, presumably possessing just enough of a rare substance to tint its oceans and horizons, like how one drop of any additive can remarkably change the flavor of a mug of juice. Fortunately, nobody has made the claim...yet, that Eve is full of grape juice.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Gilly_desc = Gilly is a lumpy rock wandering around the orbit of Eve. It was once and for a long time believed to be the smallest natural satellite that the Kerbal Astronomical Society ever discovered, but that changed when the concept of colonizing the asteroid field suddenly became very interesting to those who weren't afraid of it.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Hamek_desc = This wonderfully mis-colored world dances and sways in and out of the depths of Kuiper Kerman's Belt. At this level of distance, expectation is high that only ice planets can exist here, so Hamek's redness is currently beyond all reason.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Huygen_desc = With thick, hazy atmosphere and distinct amber sheen, Huygen has kept astronomers thinking hard, and somewhat scared, for the annoyingly short time scale by which they've been aware of it. Whether this moon is as hostile as Eve or deceptively quite approachable waits to be confirmed.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Ike_desc = A pale sphere looms over the seeming desolate red planet, much like the one that has always been near to kerbal-kind and possibly serving all of the exact same purposes. Why, asks the Mun-gazers, is Ike so alike?
		#LOC_JNSQ_Jool_desc = By sheer size, Jool stands the tallest among the local planets, and it ties with Kerbin for the title of richest celestial body (by composition). Its primary color is inexplicably the same as the skin of a kerbal, and the variety among its moons is exceedingly wide and unparalleled to date, making Jool the chief source of inspiration to Kerbal-kind for interplanetary and eventually, interstellar colonization.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Kerbin_desc = A wondrous green and blue world, Kerbin is the only planet known to have given rise to life forms capable of more than instinctive action. Now these life forms, calling themselves Kerbals, seek to depart their nest and set foot in the deep. Half of the grand challenge ahead of them is just getting into orbit. Will they make it?
		#LOC_JNSQ_Krel_desc = This small pale world orbits its parent very closely, and was very hard to distinguish until a lead astronomer lost his telescope and had to obtain a new and shinier one. He became very concerned for his age when he noted Krel's vainy appearance.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Laythe_desc = Half of the green giant's glory rests in what is the widest and heaviest moon observed yet. The hard questions easily arise at the thought of Laythe, such as: Why? How? Is it safe from Jool's radiation? How soon can we go? Can we make snacks just as good once we get there and not live on dehydrated stuff forever?
		#LOC_JNSQ_Lindor_desc = The sixth major planet, Lindor is amazingly large and is the same kind as Jool. Its swirls are fainter and calmer, instilling a particularly restful feeling into onlookers. A critical question has been raised recently- whether Lindor contains water or chocolate.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Minmus_desc = Minmus is rather small, rather distant, and rather green. As long as artisan food has existed, so has the belief that it is composed of ice cream or mint. But recently, some have wised up and begun assuming it may actually be a rust ball. Mentioning this, however, tends to lead to levels of conflict only seen in debates between two political alignments.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Moho_desc = The innermost planet is as a wise kerbal who sun-bathed too much and then got splashed by their grandchildren. Actually, that's not very wise, now is it? ...Moho has seen a lot and taken more punishment than the other local planets, so it appears. Look at those streaks! Think of what Moho might be secretly carrying now! And think of the heat too!
		#LOC_JNSQ_Mun_desc = A pale sphere looms over Kerbal-kind since time immemorial, lighting their nights and stirring their oceans. Affectionately called Mün, it hosts pleasant suprises waiting to be found, like high hanging fruit in the tree of their back yard.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Nara_desc = In classical astronomy, when close attention was paid to what would be known as Kuiper Kerman's Belt, it became apparent that there were many odd orbits, that something was stirring the ice asteroids like the LOX in a tank but having the opposite effect. The Kerbal Astronomical Society eventually realized that there was something out there with enough gravity to rival Jool and Lindor, and disturb the minor worlds beyond their reach. As Nara crept into observable ranges, it seemed like just another KB member, but the lack of apparent velocity was on a magnitude of its own, revealing its potential to be gigantic.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Pol_desc = The scientists who get to name some of these moons are the most curious kind. Pol earns its name from one who takes botany very seriously. Perhaps Pol's composition will similarly lend itself very well to off-world agriculture.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Prax_desc = In the history of kerbal-kind several great truths have been discovered. Prax itself is an example of that truth... Every great parent planet has a fringe world beside it.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Riga_desc = The largest brown marble in Lindor's hand, Riga is deemed the most interesting of them all. Its size and other observable characteristics make it as interesting as Tylo among Jool's moons. A large portion of its surface even has a subtle but clear familiarity to Kerbin.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Sun_desc = The Sun. It is power, it is life, it is heat, and it is the center of Kerbal-kind's little universe. Kerbal engineers and scientists alike have grown to realize over the centuries, that one day, they can have something like the Sun under them, burning endlessly without dwindling, propelling them above and beyond, and sustaining them in the cold and lonely expanse.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Talos_desc = The only thing that's far off about Talos is its distance from Riga or from Lindor. Its near neutral inclination suggests that it either formed here or was quickly stabilized after being captured. Its strong colorations may yield much scientific fruit when someone gets out there to sample it.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Tam_desc = Kuiper Kerman's belt has many notches and a very wide buckle. Little things like Tam appear through these notches, and kerbals who don't criticize him for wearing such a large belt do praise his eccentric fashion sense on the whole just as they praise his devotion to finding and naming the little things out there. Tam is far from the only one of its kind but it's the only one found captured by a larger body to date. Before Tam got its personal name, it carried a designation often given to the more interesting of its kind. For Tam it was KB 4089848.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Tylo_desc = Pale and large, Tylo fights for the spotlight with Laythe. As an arid world, there is little to look forward to when taken at face value. But in Jool's influence, there may be more than meets the eye.
		#LOC_JNSQ_Vall_desc = Vall is a curiously blue airless body and curiously, the last of them to be discovered, having been often mistaken for a pale asteroid in the inner asteroid belt whenever it was observed.

		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Edna = Just when we though Dres was alone in being leagues larger than anything in the asteroid belt.
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Dak = Woah. This moon is really small. We didn't expect to find it, honestly, but we're glad it is where it is. Do you think there is more of it?
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Lindor = There's a really large blue dot. A really really large blue dot. It's nearly as big as Jool!
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Krel = We've found something. Seems incredibly small but it's clearly orbiting the giant. Is it a huge asteroid?
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Aden = We found a brown dot. We found a lot of brown dots. This system is officially full of chocolate chips.
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Huygen = We've spotted a bright and sizable yellow moon! .... How are we only now noticing it?
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Riga = Oh hello. A very sizable target has entered our sights. It's fuzzy enough to possibly have an atmosphere too.
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Talos = This moon is a bit splotchy. Good thing it's big and easy to spot.
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Hamek = There's a strong red pixel. Is this screen dying? Or is that actually how this planet is?
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Celes = What's small, dark, and cold? This moon! Also, the chunk of meat that's getting freezer-burn in the fridge on 3rd floor.

		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Nara = What's this? A planet? But it's so far past Lindor! Is it rogue? Or has it always been here?
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Amos = Wow this moon is dark! Is it a chip off of its parent's block?
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Enon = Sensor spike detected! Recalibrating. The albedo on this moon is concerningly high.
		#LOC_JNSQ_RBodies_discovery_Prax = The main planet can't be rogue! The number of moons is too damn high!
