# JNSQ
Of the French phrase *"Je Ne Sais Quoi,"* meaning *"Something (such as an appealing quality) that cannot be adequately described or expressed,"* JNSQ seeks to be a finely crafted and freshly challenging planet pack. "Galileo's Planet Pack (GPP)" as many have come to know, has broken many conventions and raised the bar very high for high-quality, challenging, career-friendly, and long-term thrilling planet packs. But now it is regarded as only a stepping stone next to this. Everything that Team Galileo has done for and learned from GPP, has been or is being put into practice here.

Unlike GPP, JNSQ does not remove the stock planets but rather, does reimagine and reinvent them, destroying what you think you know about some of them, and answering the KSP community's cry for a true stock planet visual overhaul and the cry for the planets to be larger. JNSQ also fills out the local planetary system, providing several all new worlds to discover, with a total body count of 31, the amount in GPP.

## Logic
Many KSP modders have considered that while the stock parts (namely, engines) are overpowered for stock scale, they are tuned just right for 2.5x scale. With this in mind, JNSQ is built in natively "1/4 real-life scale" (about 2.7x stock scale) which is modestly larger than 2.5x. Because of this change in scale, the length of the Kerbin day is now 12 hours.

## Notes
* **Sigma Dimensions** and **Rescale!** are not required for JNSQ to function, and are discouraged from use alongside JNSQ.
* When starting new saves under JNSQ, we advise that you enter Difficulty Settings and raise the DSN modifier to 4x. JNSQ applies a patch to increase antenna range by 4x, so leave the range modifier at 1 (changing it triggers a bug that may prevent science transmission).
* The Making History LV-TX87 and LV-T91 engines have had their thrust, mass and cost increased 25% and 20% respectively. This change was deemed necessary to assure they can lift a Mk2 command pod and service module to low orbit at JNSQ's larger scale.
* JNSQ retains the stockalike Kerbin-Mun-Minmus system to conform to game elements outside or our control, such as the built-in contract system. Be advised, however, this configuration is unstable when using n-body physics. For users of the mod Principia, the orbit of Minmus is moved inside that of Mun to provide orbital stability.
* JNSQ raises the SCANsat scan altitudes by 1.5x in order to allow reasonable scan speeds at 2.7x scale, and viable scan work at all but the smallest bodies.
* JNSQ changes Duna to be very Mars-like which means lowering its atmosphere pressure to 0.04 atm and includes the Sigma TweakChutes plugin which fixes the stock bug of chutes not checking their partial deploy limit and being able to fully deploy when they should be unable to. This consequently makes it so that the player must approach Duna like any real space agency would: Drogue chutes and powered landings only.
* JNSQ provides at least 14 facilities powered by Kerbal Konstructs + [Omega's Stockalike Stuctures](https://spacedock.info/mod/2061/Omega%27s%20Stockalike%20Structures:%20No%20Textures%20Required). Most of these facilities have gameplay features within them for making use of spare kerbals, launching and refueling ships, farming funds or science, expanding DSN coverage, recovering for funds in career. Most of these facilities are hidden by default and must be found.
  * 9 of these are airports.
  * 2 of these directly replace the MH launch sites (Woomera2 for Woomerang, and Darude for Dessert).
  * 2 of these are mountain-top observatories with science farming and full DSN capabilities. 

## Disclaimer / Barrier to Entry
:warning: The target audience for JNSQ is the same as, if not narrower, than that of GPP. This mod is made not for the player-base at large, but for seasoned players: who greatly respect rocketry, realism and physics; who do not hold much regard for maintaining "stockalike" and "stock scale;" who are willing and able to mod their way to a great or greater game and who are able to troubleshoot a damaged install for themselves and help us to help them.

JNSQ introduces and recommends a utility mod that depends on the Community Resource Pack (or WBI Classic Stock) and makes Ore even more scarce and challenging than GPP does. This mod is appropriately called [Rational Resources](https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/RationalResources), whose purpose is to purge the random resource configurations generated by CRP, grant increased compatibility between planet packs and mods that use certain resources, and encourage the use of mods that use advanced resources.

Compatibility for mods that expect the stock planets with default topology, biomes, order or radii is not to be expected and will not be provided by us.

The three Team Galileo planet packs - JNSQ, GPP (secondary mode) and GEP - are designed to be installed together and work in concert. However, since JNSQ is built natively to a different scale than GPP and GEP, 

JNSQ is not recommended for use with other planet packs, other than those specifically endorsed by Team Galileo. At present, only Galileo's Planet Pack (GPP) and Grannus Expansion Pack (GEP) are designed to work alongside JNSQ. Because of differences in native scale, resizing is necessary to allow the planet packs to co-exist in the same install. To this end, optional Rescale mods are provided to enable all three planet packs to be set to the same scale. Questions regarding other planet pack compatibility will be ignored.

## Recommended Mods
### Parts
* [Eve Optimized Engines](https://github.com/OhioBob/Eve-Optimized-Engines/releases). An engine pack tailored for Eve ascent vehicles.
* [JX2 Antenna](https://spacedock.info/mod/1107/JX2Antenna), late-game antennae made to reduce the need to spam RA-15 and RA-100 and preclude the need to install Custom Barn Kit.

### Utilities
* [Antenna Helper](https://spacedock.info/mod/1730/Antenna%20Helper) adequately and easily shows the power and ranges of combined antenna in VAB, flight and the Tracking Station.
* [Better SRBs](https://github.com/OhioBob/BetterSRBs/releases): Although a small engine pack, it is primarily a utility. This mod adds very much needed behavior and appropriate rebalances to SRBs in stock and in a handful of popular large parts packs.
* [CommNet Antennas Info](https://spacedock.info/mod/2039/CommNet%20Antennas%20Info) expands the panel info for antennae in the VAB.
* [Contract Reward Modifier](https://spacedock.info/mod/132/Contract%20Reward%20Modifier) allows you to easily scale rewards and penalties to maintain their balance for up-scaled systems.
* [Kerbal Alarm Clock](https://spacedock.info/mod/699/Kerbal%20Alarm%20Clock) now works with Kronometer; lets you easily mark the times for maneuvers and encounters in many flights.
* [SCANsat](https://spacedock.info/mod/129/SCANsat): A tiny mod that adds a few parts but is critical to an exploration or ISRU game. Highly recommended for discovering anomalies including most of JNSQ's KK facilities and identifying atypical resource placements by Rational Resources.
* [Sigma Replacements](https://github.com/Sigma88/Sigma-Replacements/releases): A suite of tiny Sigma mods for changing things such as the main menu scene, kerbal suits, and the skybox.
